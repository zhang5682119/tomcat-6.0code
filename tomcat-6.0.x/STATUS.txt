   kkolinko:
    I do not see much benefit in adding classes Buffer and Thread that
    Tomcat 6 code does not use. But I see no technical issue to really
    object adding them. If someone sees a benefit, feel free to go on.

    Historical context:
     1) Initial Tomcat 6 commit (r389146) does not have those classes
         https://svn.apache.org/viewvc/tomcat/tc6.0.x/trunk/?pathrev=389146

     2) They were added to trunk in r1442914 (2013-02-06)
         https://svn.apache.org/r1442914

        A thread of that time mentions that those classes originate from
        Apache Mina. "Again: Java classes in tcnative" (2013-02-05)
         http://markmail.org/message/pohmyvfznjrpmtr2

     3) "Re: r1672047" thread (2015-04-08)
         http://markmail.org/message/ey2agr4eg5ws5stc


* Fix https://bz.apache.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=57896
  Backport org.apache.tomcat.util.http.ServerCookie.PRESERVE_COOKIE_HEADER option

  Like in Tomcat 7, the fix is to be applied to the call to
  Cookies.processCookieHeader(byte[], int, int)

  In Tomcat 6 there is also a call to Cookies.processCookieHeader(String) when
  header value is already a String, but that call does not need this fix, as
  String is immutable, and that method does not perform decoding of embedded '\"'.
  It only strips surrounding '"'s in a value.

PATCHES/ISSUES THAT ARE STALLED:

* Fix https://issues.apache.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=44312
  Log an error if there is a conflict between Host and Alias names.
  Improve host management methods in Mapper to avoid occasionally removing
  a wrong host. Check that host management operations are performed on
  the host and not on an alias.

  2) http://svn.apache.org/r1608653
  3) http://svn.apache.org/r1608833
  4) TestMapper changes from http://svn.apache.org/r1608831
  +1: kkolinko, remm, schultz
  -1:
   kkolinko: Good for occasional review, but as backporting r1608833 won't
   be trivial I'd have to update the patch.
   schultz: r1608833 is good, but it does not look like it is absolutely
   required to fix BZ 44312.
